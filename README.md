```javascript
// Example: Student progress tracking
const educationAPI = {
  baseURL: 'https://api.cyber-toolkit.edu/v2',
  
  async getStudentProgress(studentId) {
    const response = await fetch(`${this.baseURL}/students/${studentId}/progress`, {
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${EDU_API_KEY}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      }
    });
    return response.json();
  },
  
  async submitAssessment(studentId, assessmentData) {
    const response = await fetch(`${this.baseURL}/assessments/submit`, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${EDU_API_KEY}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        studentId,
        ...assessmentData
      })
    });
    return response.json();
  }
};

// Framework alignment tracking
const frameworkAPI = {
  async trackNISTAlignment(studentId, function, category) {
    return await educationAPI.post('/framework/nist/track', {
      studentId,
      function,
      category,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
    });
  },
  
  async trackMITREAlignment(studentId, tactic, technique) {
